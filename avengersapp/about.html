        <h2>About us</h2>
        <p>We are a one man team of aspiring Software developers.</p>
        <p>Ever since becoming a computer science student I have been passionate towards the field but never really did anything outside of schoolwork to persue that passion.</p>
        <p>Until now. With the FNB app academy I was able to learn more about app development.</p>
        <P>My short term goal is to win the Amazon internship, tall order I know and I hope projects like these and those to follow will make that goal more attainable.</P>
